Are you tired of constantly changing rarely used keys to other bindings? Is it too hard to remember what each key does? Allow me to introduce Keybind Bundles!\\n\\n&lCreating Bundles&r\\n\\nTo create a new bundle, go to Options, then to Controls, then open the Keybinds screen and under the KeyBind Bundles category (which should be the first) click the &lAdd key bundle&r button, and then enter a name for your bundle.\\nAfter that, click the Edit button on the bundle. In the new screen hover over the radial menu in the middle and click on Add entry. This will open the keybinds screen again but now each keybind has a select button. Here you can select the bindings you want to add to the bundle. After selecting the bindings you may edit each entry in the radial menu and give it a custom name and item icon. Exit the edit menu by pressing escape and bind the bundle to a key."

Once bookmarked, pressing the key assigned to the bundle will immediately trigger that mapping without opening the radial menu. When a key is bookmarked, the radial menu can be opened again by holding the &lRadial menu modifier&r, which is &lLeft alt&r by default.
